## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript and HTML DOM
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Provides testing server, build tools, etc.


### Continued development

When using a screen size other than the provided 1440x800 for desktop, the layout looks very stretched-out. More practice with design should help regarding knowing when to use px vs relative sizing.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
